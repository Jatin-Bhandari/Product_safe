      "Product name: Kurkure\n",
      "Product type: Food (processed snack)\n",
      "Brand: PepsiCo, Inc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients Overview\n",
      "Kurkure is primarily composed of cereal products (rice meal, corn meal) and gram meal (chickpea flour). It is cooked in edible vegetable oil (palmolein). The product contains a seasoning blend with spices, sugar, iodised salt, and various food additives.\n",
      "Key ingredients: Rice meal, corn meal, palmolein oil, gram meal.\n",
      "Seasoning components: Cinnamon, other spices and condiments, sugar, iodised salt, corn oil.\n",
      "Chemicals (Food Additives):\n",
      " Acidity Regulators: 330 (Citric Acid), 296 (Malic Acid) – used for tartness and flavor.\n",
      " Flavour Enhancers: 627 (Disodium Guanylate), 631 (Disodium Inosinate) – enhance savory flavors.\n",
      " Color: 160c (Paprika extract) – provides orange-red color.\n",
      " Emulsifier: 414 (Acacia Gum) – helps stabilize ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Potential Benefits\n",
      "Kurkure is a processed snack and offers minimal nutritional benefits.\n",
      "Energy source: Provides carbohydrates and fats for energy.\n",
      "Convenience: Easy to consume as a quick snack.\n",
      "Sensory enjoyment: Offers a distinct flavor and texture experience for consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Safety Considerations\n",
      "General consumption: Kurkure is safe for consumption when consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet. It is a processed snack, often high in calories, fats, and sodium, which if consumed excessively, can contribute to weight gain and other health issues.\n",
      "Additives:\n",
      " Acidity Regulators (330, 296): Citric acid and malic acid are common food acids, generally recognized as safe.\n",
      " Flavour Enhancers (627, 631): Disodium guanylate and disodium inosinate are typically used with glutamates to enhance umami flavor. They are generally considered safe for consumption by regulatory bodies worldwide.\n",
      " Color (160c): Paprika extract is a natural-derived food coloring, widely considered safe.\n",
      " Emulsifier (414): Acacia gum (gum arabic) is a natural gum, widely used and considered safe.\n",
      "Allergens and dietary restrictions: The product contains onion and garlic, as stated in the warnings. This is important for individuals with specific allergies or dietary preferences (e.g., those avoiding alliums for religious or health reasons).\n",
      "Portion control: The warning about \"Pack less than 20 g is a single consumption pack\" indicates an awareness of portion sizing for a snack food.\n",
      "\n",
      "International Regulatory Status\n",
      "The product Kurkure itself is widely available and allowed in India, as indicated by the FSSAI certification (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India). It is also marketed in various other countries, including some in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, subject to their respective food regulations. There is no information to suggest the product itself is banned in any major country.\n",
      "The ingredients and chemical additives are generally allowed in most major food regulatory regions worldwide:\n",
      "Acidity Regulators (330, 296): Citric acid and malic acid are broadly approved for use in food products by regulatory bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), and Health Canada.\n",
      "Flavour Enhancers (627, 631): Disodium guanylate and disodium inosinate are permitted food additives in the US, EU, Australia, Canada, and many other countries.\n",
      "Color (160c): Paprika extract is an approved food coloring agent globally.\n",
      "Emulsifier (414): Acacia gum is widely approved as a food additive in most countries.\n",
      "While specific maximum usage levels and labeling requirements for these additives can vary between countries, the substances themselves are not banned for general food use.\n"
